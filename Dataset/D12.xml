We are moving from centralized access points, such as search engines, towards highly specialized, and yet fragmented, functionalities in disconnected apps. This talk explores an entity-centric conversational interface as a mechanism to overcome this fragmentation, highlighting the numerous associated NLP challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Consider mobile scenarios, where the traditional search engine paradigm is being cannibalized by search and browse functionalities built directly into specialized apps. For example, while users can search for restaurants and products using their mobile browser, they are increasingly turning directly to applications such as Yelp, Urbanspoon and Amazon. However, interoperability between applications and lacking generalized interfaces to their functionalities pose serious scalability challenges. In this talk, we argue for an entity-centric conversational interface in which natural user interactions with entities are paired with actions that can be performed on the entities, thus enabling the brokering of web pages and applications that can satisfy the intended action. In this vision, the broker is aware of all entities and actions of interest to its users, understands the intent of the user, and provides direct actionable results through APIs with external providers satisfying the intent. The user saves clicks and time to accomplish her intended action and can discover related actions. New revenue streams open up from paid action placement and lead generation opportunities. At the forefront of this direction are a number of NLP challenges in the areas of entity recognition, entity linking, knowledge extraction, intent recognition, and dialog modeling, to name a few. We end by proposing one particular technique for learning and mapping user intents in a search interface. In an annotation study conducted over a traffic sample of web usage logs, we found that a large proportion of user queries involve actions on entities, calling for an automatic approach to identifying relevant actions for entity-bearing queries. We pose the problem of finding actions ix that can be performed on entities as the problem of doing probabilistic inference in a graphical model that captures how entity-bearing information requests are generated. Given a large collection of real-world queries and clicks from a commercial search engine, the models are learned efficiently through maximum likelihood estimation using an EM algorithm. Given a new query, inference enables the recommendation of a set of pertinent actions and providers. We propose an evaluation methodology for measuring the relevance of our recommended actions, and show empirical evidence of the quality and the diversity of the discovered actions.</abstractText><title>Syntactic Transfer Using a Bilingual Lexicon</title><author>Adam Pauls Durrett</author><affiliation>Computer Science University of California,</affiliation><abstractText>We consider the problem of using a bilingual dictionary to transfer lexico-syntactic information from a resource-rich source language to a resource-poor target language. In contrast to past work that used bitexts to transfer analyses of specific sentences at the token level, we instead use features to transfer the behavior of words at a type level. In a discriminative dependency parsing framework, our approach produces gains across a range of target languages, using two different lowresource training methodologies (one weakly supervised and one indirectly supervised) and two different dictionary sources (one manually constructed and one automatically constructed).</abstractText><title>Regularized Interlingual Evaluation on Multilingual Transliteration</title><author>Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi Hal Daumé</author><affiliation>University of Maryland University of Maryland</affiliation><abstractText>In this paper, we address the problem of building a multilingual transliteration system using an interlingual representation. Our approach uses international phonetic alphabet (IPA) to learn the interlingual representation and thus allows us to use any word and its IPA representation as a training example. Thus, our approach requires only monolingual resources: a dictionary lists words and their By adding a phoneme dictionary of a new language, we can readily build a transliteration system into any of the existing previous languages, without the expense of all-pairs data or computation. We also propose a regularization framework for learning the interlingual representation, which accounts for language specific phonemic variability, and thus it can find better mappings between languages. Experimental results on the name transliteration task in five diverse languages show a maximum improvement of 29% accuracy and an average improvement of 17% accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art baseline system.</abstractText><title>Bilingual Lexicon Extraction from Comparable Corpora Using Label Propagation</title><author>Tamura Watanabe</author><affiliation>Multilingual Translation Laboratory, MASTAR National Institute of Information and Communications</affiliation><abstractText>This paper proposes a novel method for lexicon extraction that extracts translation pairs from comparable corpora by using graphbased label propagation. In previous work, it was established that performance drastically decreases when the coverage of a seed lexicon is small. We resolve this problem by utilizing indirect relations with the bilingual seeds together with direct relations, in which each word is represented by a distribution of translated seeds. The seed distributions are propagated over a graph representing relations among words, and translation pairs are extracted by identifying word pairs with a high similarity in the seed distributions. We propose two types of the graphs: a co-occurrence graph, representing co-occurrence relations between words, and a similarity graph, representing context similarities between words. Evaluations using English and Japanese patent comparable corpora show that our proposed graph propagation method outperforms conventional methods. Further, the similarity graph achieved improved performance by clustering synonyms into the same translation.</abstractText><title>Lexical Differences in Autobiographical Narratives from Patients and Healthy Controls</title><author>Christian G Mary E Amber A Ani</author><affiliation>University of</affiliation><abstractText>We present a system for automatic identification of schizophrenic patients and healthy controls based on narratives the subjects recounted about emotional experiences in their own life. The focus of the study is to identify the lexical features that distinguish the two populations. We report the results of feature selection experiments that demonstrate that the classifier can achieve accuracy on patient level prediction as high as 76.9% with only a small set of features. We provide an in-depth discussion of the lexical features that distinguish the two groups and the unexpected relationship between emotion types of the narratives and the accuracy of patient status prediction.</abstractText><title>Streaming Analysis of Discourse Participants</title><author>Benjamin Van_Durme</author><affiliation>Human Language Technology Center of Johns Hopkins University</affiliation><abstractText>Inferring attributes of discourse participants been treated as a task: data such as all tweets from a given author are gathered in bulk, processed, analyzed for a particular feature, then reported as a result of academic interest. Given the sources and scale of material used in these efforts, along with potential use cases of such analytic tools, discourse analysis should be reconsidered as We show that under certain common formulations, the batchprocessing analytic framework can be decomposed into a sequential series of updates, using as an example the task of gender classification. Once in a streaming framework, and motivated by large data sets generated by social media services, we present novel results in approximate counting, showing its applicability to space efficient streaming classification.</abstractText><title>Multiple Aspect Summarization Using Integer Linear Programming</title><author>Woodsend</author><affiliation>Institute for Language, Cognition and School of Informatics, University of</affiliation><abstractText>Multi-document summarization involves many aspects of content selection and surface realization. The summaries must be informative, succinct, grammatical, and obey stylistic writing conventions. We present a method where such individual aspects are learned separately from data (without any hand-engineering) but optimized jointly using an integer linear programme. The ILP framework allows us to combine the decisions of the expert learners and to select and rewrite source content through a mixture of objective setting, soft and hard constraints. Experimental results on the TAC-08 data set show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance using ROUGE and significantly improves the informativeness of the summaries.</abstractText><title>Minimal Dependency Length in Realization Ranking</title><author>White</author><affiliation>Department of The Ohio State</affiliation><abstractText>Comprehension and corpus studies have found that the tendency to minimize dependency length has a strong influence on constituent ordering choices. In this paper, we investigate dependency length minimization in the context of discriminative realization ranking, focusing on its potential to eliminate egregious ordering errors as well as better match the distributional characteristics of sentence orderings in news text. We find that with a stateof-the-art, comprehensive realization ranking model, dependency length minimization yields statistically significant improvements in BLEU scores and significantly reduces the number of heavy/light ordering errors. Through distributional analyses, we also show that with simpler ranking models, dependency length minimization can go overboard, too often sacrificing canonical word order to shorten dependencies, while richer models manage to better counterbalance the dependency length minimization preference against (sometimes) competing canonical word order preferences.</abstractText><title>Framework of Automatic Text Using Reinforcement Learning</title><author>Seonggi Takeshi</author><affiliation>Graduate School of National Institute of Science and abekawa@nii.ac.jp University of</affiliation><abstractText>We present a new approach to the problem of automatic text summarization called Automatic Summarization using Reinforcement Learning (ASRL) in this paper, which models the process of constructing a summary within the framework of reinforcement learning and attempts to optimize the given score function with the given feature representation of a summary. We demonstrate that the method of reinforcement learning can be adapted to automatic summarization problems naturally and simply, and other summarizing techniques, such as sentence compression, can be easily adapted as actions of the framework. The experimental results indicated ASRL was superior to the best performing method in DUC2004 and comparable to the state of the art ILP-style method, in terms of ROUGE scores. The results also revealed ASRL can search for sub-optimal solutions efficiently under conditions for effectively selecting features and the score function.</abstractText><title>Large Scale Decipherment for Out-of-Domain Machine Translation</title><author>Kevin</author><affiliation>Information Sciences Institute Department of Computer Science University of Southern</affiliation><abstractText>We apply slice sampling to Bayesian decipherment and use our new decipherment framework to improve out-of-domain machine translation. Compared with the state of the art algorithm, our approach is highly scalable and produces better results, which allows us to decipher ciphertext with billions of tokens and hundreds of thousands of word types with high accuracy. We decipher a large amount of monolingual data to improve out-of-domain translation and achieve significant gains of up to 3.8 BLEU points.</abstractText><title>N-gram-based Tense Models for Statistical Machine Translation</title><affiliation>of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China Language Technology, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore</affiliation><abstractText>Tense is a small element to a sentence, however, error tense can raise odd grammars and result in misunderstanding. Recently, tense has drawn attention in many natural language processing applications. However, most of current Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems mainly depend on translation model and language model. They never consider and make full use of tense information. In this paper, we propose n-gram-based tense models for SMT and successfully integrate them into a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system via two additional features. Experimental results on the NIST Chinese-English translation task show that our proposed tense models are very effective, contributing performance improvement by 0.62 BLUE points over a strong baseline.</abstractText><title>Source Language Adaptation for Resource-Poor Machine Translation</title><author>Hwee Tou</author><affiliation>Department of Computer National University of 13 Computing</affiliation><abstractText>We propose a novel, language-independent approach for improving machine translation a resource-poor language to adaptlarge bi-text for a related resource-rich and same target language). We assume a small bi-text for the resourcelanguage to which we use to learn word-level and phrase-level paraphrases and cross-lingual morphological variants between the resource-rich and the resource-poor language; we then adapt the former to get closer to the latter. Our experiments for Indonesian/Malay–English translation show that using the large adapted resource-rich bitext yields 6.7 BLEU points of improvement over the unadapted one and 2.6 BLEU points over the original small bi-text. Moreover, combining the small bi-text with the adapted bi-text outperforms the corresponding combinations with the unadapted bi-text by 1.5– 3 BLEU points. We also demonstrate applicability to other languages and domains.</abstractText><title>Exploiting Reducibility in Unsupervised Dependency Parsing</title><author>Mareˇcek</author><affiliation>Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Mathematics and Institute of Formal and Applied</affiliation><abstractText>The possibility of deleting a word from a sentence without violating its syntactic correctness belongs to traditionally known manifestations of syntactic dependency. We introduce a novel unsupervised parsing approach that is based on a new n-gram reducibility measure. We perform experiments across 18 languages available in CoNLL data and we show that our approach achieves better accuracy for the majority of the languages then previously reported results.</abstractText><title>Improving Transition-Based Dependency Parsing with Buffer Transitions</title><author>Daniel</author><affiliation>Departamento de Universidade de Campus As Lagoas,</affiliation><abstractText>Carlos Departamento de da de carlos.gomez@udc.es Abstract In this paper, we show that significant improvements in the accuracy of well-known transition-based parsers can be obtained, without sacrificing efficiency, by enriching the parsers with simple transitions that act on buffer nodes. First, we show how adding a specific transition to create either a left or right arc of length one between the first two buffer nodes produces improvements in the accuracy of Nivre’s arc-eager projective parser on a number of datasets from the CoNLL-X shared task. Then, we show that accuracy can also be improved by adding transitions involving the topmost stack node and the second buffer node (allowing a limited form of non-projectivity). None of these transitions has a negative impact on the computational complexity of the algorithm. Although the experiments in this paper use the arc-eager parser, the approach is generic enough to be applicable to any stackbased dependency parser.</abstractText><title>Universal Grapheme-to-Phoneme Prediction Over Latin Alphabets</title><author>Benjamin</author><affiliation>University of</affiliation><abstractText>We consider the problem of inducing grapheme-to-phoneme mappings for unknown languages written in a Latin alphabet. First, we collect a data-set of 107 languages with known grapheme-phoneme relationships, along with a short text in each language. We then cast our task in the framework of supervised learning, where each known language serves as a training example, and predictions are made on unknown languages. We induce an undirected graphical model that learns phonotactic regularities, thus relating textual patterns to plausible phonemic interpretations across the entire range of languages. Our model correctly predicts grapheme-phoneme pairs with over 88% F1-measure.</abstractText><title>Name Phylogeny: A Generative Model of String Variation</title><author>Andrews Eisner</author><affiliation>Department of Computer Science and Human Language Technology Center of</affiliation><abstractText>Many linguistic and textual processes involve transduction of strings. We show how to learn a stochastic transducer from an unorganized collection of strings (rather than string pairs). The role of the transducer is to organize the collection. Our generative model explains similarities among the strings by supposing that some strings the collection were not generated but were instead derived by transduction from other, “similar” strings in the collection. Our variational EM learning algorithm alternately reestimates this phylogeny and the transducer parameters. The final learned transducer can quickly link any test name into the final phylogeny, thereby locating variants of the test name. We find that our method can effectively find name variants in a corpus of web strings used to refer to persons in Wikipedia, improving over standard untrained distances such as Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein distance.</abstractText><title>Syntactic surprisal affects spoken word duration in conversational contexts</title><author>Nikolaos MCI Cluster of Excellence</author><affiliation>Department of Computational Linguistics and Saarland</affiliation><abstractText>We present results of a novel experiment to investigate speech production in conversational data that links speech rate to information density. We provide the first evidence for an association between syntactic surprisal and word duration in recorded speech. Using the AMI corpus which contains transcriptions of focus group meetings with precise word durations, we show that word durations correlate with syntactic surprisal estimated from the incremental Roark parser over and above simpler measures, such as word duration estimated from a state-of-the-art text-to-speech system and word frequencies, and that the syntactic surprisal estimates are better predictors of word durations than a simpler version of surprisal based on trigram probabilities. This result supports the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis and points a way to more realistic artificial speech generation.</abstractText><title>Why Question Answering using Sentiment Analysis and Word Classes</title><author>Kentaro Hashimoto</author><affiliation>De Information Analysis Laboratory Universal Communication Research Institute National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)</affiliation><abstractText>In this paper we explore the utility of sentiment analysis and semantic word classes for improving why-question answering on a large-scale web corpus. Our work is motivated by the observation that a why-question its answer often follow the pattern that something undesirable happens, the reason is often something and something desirable happens, the reason is also ofsomething To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces sentiment analysis to non-factoid question answering. We combine this simple idea with semantic word classes for ranking answers to why-questions and show that on a set of 850 why-questions our method gains 15.2% improvement in precision at the top-1 answer over a baseline state-of-the-art QA system that achieved the best performance in a shared task of Japanese non-factoid QA in NTCIR-6.</abstractText><title>Natural Language Questions for the Web of Data</title><author>Klaus Shady Volker Gerhard</author><affiliation>1Max Planck Institute for Informatics, 2Qatar Computing Research 3Dept. of CSE, IIT-Delhi, India 4Siemens AG, Corporate Technology, Munich,</affiliation><abstractText>The Linked Data initiative comprises structured databases in the Semantic-Web data model RDF. Exploring this heterogeneous data by structured query languages is tedious and error-prone even for skilled users. To ease the task, this paper presents a methodology for translating natural language questions into structured SPARQL queries over linked-data sources. Our method is based on an integer linear program to solve several disambiguation tasks jointly: the segmentation of questions into phrases; the mapping of phrases to semantic entities, classes, and relations; and the construction of SPARQL triple patterns. Our solution harnesses the rich type system provided by knowledge bases in the web of linked data, to constrain our semantic-coherence objective function. We present experiments on both the question translation and the resulting query answering.</abstractText><title>Answering Opinion Questions on Products by Exploiting Organization of Consumer Reviews</title><author>Tat-Seng</author><affiliation>School of National University of</affiliation><abstractText>This paper proposes to generate appropriate answers for opinion questions about products by exploiting the hierarchical organization of consumer reviews. The hierarchy organizes product aspects as nodes following their parent-child relations. For each aspect, the reviews and corresponding opinions on this aspect are stored. We develop a new framework for opinion Questions Answering, which enables accurate question analysis and effective answer generation by making use the hierarchy. In particular, we first identify the (explicit/implicit) product aspects asked in the questions and their sub-aspects by referring to the hierarchy. We then retrieve the corresponding review fragments relevant to the aspects from the hierarchy. In order to generate appropriate answers from the review fragments, we develop a multi-criteria optimization approach for answer generation by simultaneously taking into account review salience, coherence, diversity, and parent-child relations among the aspects. We conduct evaluations on 11 popular products in four domains. The evaluated corpus contains 70,359 consumer reviews and 220 questions on these products. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</abstractText><title>Locally Training the Log-Linear Model for SMT</title><author>Hailong Taro Tiejun Mo CongHui</author><affiliation>of Computer Science and Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Institute of Information and Communication</affiliation><abstractText>In statistical machine translation, minimum error rate training (MERT) is a standard method for tuning a single weight with regard to a given development data. However, due to the diversity and uneven distribution of source sentences, there are two problems suffered by this method. First, its performance is highly dependent on the choice of a development set, which may lead to an unstable performance for testing. Second, translations become inconsistent at the sentence level since tuning is performed globally on a document level. In this paper, we propose a novel local training method to address these two problems. Unlike a global training method, such as MERT, in which a single weight is learned and used for all the input sentences, we perform training and testing in one step by learning a sentencewise weight for each input sentence. We propose efficient incremental training methods to put the local training into practice. In NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks, our local training method significantly outperforms MERT with the maximal improvements up to 2.0 BLEU points, meanwhile its efficiency is comparable to that of the global method.</abstractText><title>Iterative Annotation Transformation with Predict-Self for Chinese Word Segmentation</title><author>Jiang Meng Liu L¨u</author><affiliation>Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Institute of Computing</affiliation><abstractText>In this paper we first describe the technology of automatic annotation transformation, which is based on the annotation adaptation algorithm (Jiang et al., 2009). It can automatically transform a human-annotated corpus from one annotation guideline to another. We then propose two optimization strategies, iterative training and predict-self reestimation, to further improve the accuracy of annotation guideline transformation. Experiments on Chinese word segmentation show that, the iterative training strategy together with predictself reestimation brings significant improvement over the simple annotation transformation baseline, and leads to classifiers with significantly higher accuracy and several times faster processing than annotation adaptation does. On the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0, achieves an F-measure of significantly outperforms previous works although using a single classifier with only local features.</abstractText><title>Automatically Constructing a Normalisation Dictionary for Microblogs</title><author>More accurate tests for the sta-</author><affiliation>significance of result differences.

B¨orschinger et al. (2011) introduced an approach to grounded language learning based on unsupervised PCFG induction. Their approach works well when each sentence potentially refers to one of a small set of possible meanings, such as in the sportscasting task. However, it does not scale to problems with a large set of potential meanings for each sentence, such as the navigation instruction following task studied by Chen and Mooney (2011). This paper presents an enhancement of the PCFG approach that scales to such problems with highly-ambiguous supervision. Experimental results on the navigation task demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</abstractText><title>Forced Derivation Tree based Model Training Statistical Machine Translation</title><author>Ming Zhou</author><affiliation>Microsoft Research Asia</affiliation><abstractText>derivation tree of a sentence a derivation tree that can its accurate target translation In this paper, we present an approach that leverages structured knowledge contained in FDTs to train component models for statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. We first describe how to generate different FDTs for each sentence pair in training corpus, and then present how to infer the optimal FDTs based on their derivation and alignment qualities. As the first step in this line of research, we verify the effectiveness of our approach in a BTGbased phrasal system, and propose four FDTbased component models. Experiments are carried out on large scale English-to-Japanese and Chinese-to-English translation tasks, and significant improvements are reported on both translation quality and alignment quality.</abstractText><title>Multi-instance Multi-label Learning for Relation Extraction</title><author>CA Stanford</author><affiliation>Intelligence Center, SRI</affiliation><abstractText>C Distant supervision for relation extraction (RE) – gathering training data by aligning a database of facts with text – is an efficient approach to scale RE to thousands of different relations. However, this introduces a challenging learning scenario where the relation expressed by a pair of entities found in a sentence is unknown. For example, a sentence express an unknown relation, or no relation at all. Because of this, traditional supervised learning, which assumes that each example is explicitly mapped to a label, is not appropriate. We propose a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for RE, which jointly models all the instances of a pair of entities in text and all their labels using a graphical model with latent variables. Our model performs competitively on two difficult domains.</abstractText><title>An “AI readability” formula for French as a foreign language</title><author>C´edrick</author><affiliation>CENTAL, Place Blaise Pascal,</affiliation><abstractText>This paper present a new readability formula for French as a foreign language (FFL), which relies on 46 textual features representative of the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels as well as some of the specificities of the FFL context.

Our best model, based on support vector machines (SVM), significantly outperforms previous FFL formulas.

Our iterative method cautiously constructs clusters of entity and event mentions using linear regression to model cluster merge operations. As clusters are built, information flows between entity and event clusters through features that model semantic role dependencies. Our system handles nominal and verbal events as well as entities, and our joint formulation allows information from event coreference to help entity coreference, and vice versa. In a cross-document domain with comparable documents, joint coreference resolution performs significantly better (over 3 CoNLL F1 points) than two strong baselines that resolve entities and events separately.</abstractText><title>Joint Chinese Word Segmentation, POS Tagging and Parsing</title><author>Xian Qian Yang Liu</author><affiliation>Computer Science Department The University of Texas at Dallas</affiliation><abstractText>In this paper, we propose a novel decoding algorithm for discriminative joint Chinese word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and parsing. Previous work often used a pipeline method – Chinese word segmentation followed by POS tagging and parsing, which suffers from error propagation and is unable to leverage information in later modules for earlier components. In our approach, we train the three individual models separately during training, and incorporate them together in a unified framework during decoding. We extend the CYK parsing algorithm so that it can deal with word segmentation and POS tagging features. As far as we know, this is the first work on joint Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing. Our experimental results on Chinese Tree Bank 5 corpus show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art pipeline system.</abstractText><title>Translation Model Based Cross-Lingual Language Model Adaptation: from Word Models to Phrase Models</title><author>Bo</author><affiliation>Interactive Digital Media Technology Research Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of</affiliation><abstractText>In this paper, we propose a novel translation model (TM) based cross-lingual data selection model for language model (LM) adaptation in statistical machine translation (SMT), from word models to phrase models. Given a source sentence in the translation task, this model directly estimates the probability that a sentence in the target LM training corpus is similar. Compared with the traditional approaches which utilize the first pass translation hypotheses, cross-lingual data selection model avoids the problem of noisy proliferation. Furthermore, phrase TM based cross-lingual data selection model is more effective than the traditional approaches based on bag-ofwords models and word-based TM, because it captures contextual information in modeling the selection of phrase as a whole. Experiments conducted on large-scale data sets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on both LM perplexity and SMT performance.</abstractText><title>Open Language Learning for Information Extraction</title><author>Oren</author><affiliation>Department of Computer Science and University of Washington,</affiliation><abstractText>Open Information Extraction (IE) systems extract relational tuples from text, without requiring a pre-specified vocabulary, by identifying relation phrases and associated arguments in arbitrary sentences.

We experiment with several possible combinations of representation and composition, exhibiting varying degrees of sophistication. Some are shallow while others operate over syntactic structure, rely on parameter learning, or require access to very large corpora. We find that shallow approaches are as good as more computationally intensive alternatives with regards to two particular tests: (1) phrase similarity and (2) paraphrase detection. The sizes of the involved training corpora and the generated vectors are not as important as the fit between the meaning representation and compositional method.</abstractText><title>Exploiting Chunk-level Features to Improve Phrase Chunking</title><author>Junsheng Zhou Weiguang Qu Fen</author><affiliation> Privacy School of Computer Science and</affiliation><abstractText>Most existing systems solved the phrase chunking task with the sequence labeling approaches, in which the chunk candidates cannot be treated as a whole during parsing process so that the chunk-level features cannot be exploited in a natural way. In this paper, we formulate phrase chunking as a joint segmentation and labeling task. We propose an efficient dynamic programming algorithm with pruning for decoding, which allows the direct use of the features describing the internal characteristics of chunk and the features capturing the correlations between adjacent chunks. A relaxed, online maximum margin training algorithm is used for learning. Within this framework, we explored a variety of effective feature representations for Chinese phrase chunking. The experimental results show that the use of chunk-level features can lead to significant performance improvement, and that our approach achieves performance. In particular, our approach is much better at recognizing long and complicated phrases.</abstractText><title>A Beam-Search Decoder for Grammatical Error Correction</title><author>Tou</author><affiliation>Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and of Computer Science, National University of</affiliation><abstractText>We present a novel beam-search decoder for grammatical error correction.

Furthermore, by combining these extracted causality and contradiction pairs, we can generate one million plausible causality hypotheses that are not written in any single sentence in our corpus with reasonable precision.</abstractText><title>Enlarging Paraphrase Collections through Generalization and Instantiation</title><author>Pierre Isabelle Roland Kuhn</author><affiliation>National Research Council</affiliation><abstractText>This paper presents a paraphrase acquisition method that uncovers and exploits generalities underlying paraphrases: paraphrase patterns are first induced and then used to collect novel instances. Unlike existing methods, ours uses both bilingual parallel and monolingual corpora. While the former are regarded as a source of high-quality seed paraphrases, the latter are searched for paraphrases that match patterns learned from the seed paraphrases. We show how one can use monolingual corpora, which are far more numerous and larger than bilingual corpora, to obtain paraphrases that rival in quality those derived directly from bilingual corpora. In our experiments, the number of paraphrase pairs obtained in this way from monolingual corpora was a large multiple of the number of seed paraphrases. Human evaluation through a paraphrase substitution test demonstrated that the newly acquired paraphrase pairs are of reasonable quality. Remaining noise can be further reduced by filtering seed paraphrases.</abstractText><title>Modeling and predicting personal information</title><author>Cognition The</author><affiliation>of Argument Cambridge,</affiliation><abstractText>behavior.

An Exploration of Graph-based for Cross-domain Sentiment Classification</title><author>Mike</author><affiliation>Statistical Cybermetrics Research University of Wolverhampton,</affiliation><abstractText>This paper presents a comparative study of graph-based approaches for cross-domain sentiment classification. In particular, the paper analyses two existing methods: an optimisation problem and a ranking algorithm. We compare these graph-based methods with each other and with the other state-ofthe-art approaches and conclude that graph domain representations offer a competitive solution to the domain adaptation problem. Analysis of the best parameters for graphbased algorithms reveals that there are no optimal values valid for all domain pairs and that these values are dependent on the characteristics of corresponding domains.</abstractText><title>Learning Lexicon Models from Search Logs for Query Expansion</title><author>Xiaodong He Alnur Ali</author><affiliation>Microsoft Research, Redmond Microsoft Bing, Bellevue</affiliation><abstractText>This paper explores log-based query expansion (QE) models for Web search. Three lexicon models are proposed to bridge the lexical gap between Web documents and user queries. These models are trained on pairs of user queries and titles of clicked documents. Evaluations on a real world data set show that the lexicon models, integrated into a ranker-based QE system, not only significantly improve the document retrieval performance but also outperform two state-of-the-art log-based QE methods.</abstractText><title>Joint Inference for Event Timeline Construction</title><author>Quang Xuan Do Wei Lu Dan Roth</author><affiliation>Department of Computer University of Illinois at</affiliation><abstractText>This paper addresses the task of constructing a timeline of events mentioned in a given text. To accomplish that, we present a novel representation of the temporal structure of a news article based on time intervals. We then present an algorithmic approach that jointly optimizes the temporal structure by coupling local classifiers that predict associations and temporal relations between pairs of temporal entities with global constraints. Moreover, we present ways to leverage knowledge provided by event coreference to further improve the system performance. Overall, our experiments show that the joint inference model significantly outperformed the local classifiers by relative improvement in The experiments also suggest that good event coreference could make remarkable contribution to a robust event timeline construction system.</abstractText><title>Three Dependency-and-Boundary Models for Grammar Induction</title><author>Daniel Jurafsky</author><affiliation>Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305</affiliation><abstractText>We present a new family of models for unsuparsing, and Boundary models, that use cues at constituent boundaries to inform head-outward dependency tree generation. We build on three intuitions that are explicit in phrase-structure grammars but only implicit in standard dependency formulations: (i) Distributions of words that occur at sentence boundaries — such as English determiners — resemble constituent edges. (ii) Punctuation at sentence boundaries further helps distinguish full sentences from fragments like headlines and titles, allowing us to model grammatical differences between complete and incomplete sentences. (iii) Sentence-internal punctuation boundaries help with longer-distance dependencies, since punctuation correlates with constituent edges. Our models induce state-of-the-art dependency grammars for many languages without special knowledge of optimal input sentence lengths or biased, manually-tuned initializers.</abstractText><title>Macquarie</title><author>NSW Sydney</author><affiliation>Centre for Language</affiliation><abstractText>The task of inferring the native language of an author based on texts written in a second language has generally been tackled as a classification problem, typically using as features a mix of n-grams over characters and part of tags (for small and fixed and unigram function words. To capture arbitrarily long n-grams that syntax-based approaches have suggested are useful, adaptor grammars have some promise. In this work we investigate their extension to identifying n-gram collocations of arbitrary length over a mix of PoS tags and words, using both maxent and induced syntactic language model approaches to classification. After presenting a new, simple baseline, we show that learned collocations used as features in a maxent model perform better still, but that the story is more mixed for the syntactic language model.</abstractText><title>Discovering Diverse and Salient Threads in Document Collections</title><author>Jennifer Gillenwater Alex Kulesza Ben Taskar</author><affiliation>Department of Computer and Information University of</affiliation><abstractText>We propose a novel probabilistic technique for modeling and extracting salient structure from large document collections. As in clustering and topic modeling, our goal is to provide an organizing perspective into otherwise overwhelming amounts of information. We are particularly interested in and exploiting between documents. To this end, we focus on diverse sets of linked, coherent chains of important documents. To illustrate, we extract research threads from citation graphs and construct timelines from news articles. Our method is highly scalable, running on a corpus of over 30 million words in about four minutes, more than 75 times faster than a dynamic topic model. Finally, the results from our model more closely resemble human news summaries according to several metrics and are also preferred by human judges.</abstractText><title>Generalizing Sub-sentential Paraphrase across Original Signal Type of Text Pairs</title><author>Aur´elien Max Houda Bouamor Anne Vilnat</author><affiliation> Univ.

A corpus of 2,500 annotated sentences in English and French is described, and performance on this corpus is reported for an efficient system combination exploiting a large set of features for paraphrase recognition. A detailed quantified typology of subsentential paraphrases found in our corpus types is given.</abstractText><title>Parse, Price and Cut—Delayed Column and Row Generation for Graph Based Parsers</title><author>Sebastian Riedel David Smith Andrew McCallum</author><affiliation>Department of Computer University of Massachusetts, Amherst</affiliation><abstractText>Graph-based dependency parsers suffer from the sheer number of higher order edges they need to (a) score and (b) consider during optimization. Here we show that when working with LP relaxations, large fractions of these edges can be pruned before they are fully scored—without any loss of optimality guarantees and, hence, accuracy. This is achieved by iteratively parsing with a subset of higherorder edges, adding higher-order edges that may improve the score of the current solution, and adding higher-order edges that are implied by the current best first order edges. This amounts to delayed column and row generation in the LP relaxation and is guaranteed to provide the optimal LP solution. For second order grandparent models, our method considers, or scores, no more than 6–13% of the second order edges of the full model. This yields up to an eightfold parsing speedup, while providing the same empirical accuracy and certificates of optimality as working with the full LP relaxation. We also provide a tighter LP formulation for grandparent models that leads to a smaller integrality gap and higher speed.</abstractText><title>Domain Adaptation for Coreference Resolution: An Adaptive Ensemble Approach</title><author>Bo Qiao Liang Ivor W Ming A Hai Leong</author><affiliation>of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, and Computer Engineering Department, Duke University,</affiliation><abstractText>We propose an adaptive ensemble method to adapt coreference resolution across domains. This method has three features: (1) it can optimize for any user-specified objective measure; (2) it can make document-specific prediction rather than rely on a fixed base model or a fixed set of base models; (3) it can automatically adjust the active ensemble members during prediction. With simplification, this method can be used in the traditional withindomain case, while still retaining the above features. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to both (i) develop a domain adaptation algorithm for the coreference resolution problem and (ii) have the above features as an ensemble method. Empirically, we show the benefits of (i) on the six domains of the ACE 2005 data set in domain adaptation setting, and of (ii) on both the MUC-6 and the ACE 2005 data sets in within-domain setting.</abstractText><title>Weakly Supervised Training of Semantic Parsers</title><author>M Tom</author><affiliation>Carnegie Mellon</affiliation><abstractText>We present a method for training a semantic parser using only a knowledge base and an unlabeled text corpus, without any individually annotated sentences. Our key observation is that multiple forms of weak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: supervision a knowledge base, supervision dependencyparsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-theart accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form.</abstractText><title>Cross-Lingual Language Modeling with Syntactic Reordering Low-Resource Speech Recognition Ping Xu and Pascale</title><author>Hong</author><affiliation>Department of Electronic and Computer</affiliation><abstractText>This paper proposes cross-lingual language modeling for transcribing source resourcepoor languages and translating them into target resource-rich languages if necessary. Our focus is to improve the speech recognition performance of low-resource languages by leveraging the language model statistics from resource-rich languages. The most challenging work of cross-lingual language modeling is to solve the syntactic discrepancies between the source and target languages. We therefore propose syntactic reordering for cross-lingual language modeling, and present a first result that compares inversion transduction grammar (ITG) reordering constraints to IBM and local constraints in an integrated speech transcription and translation system. Evaluations on resource-poor Cantonese speech transcription and Cantonese to resource-rich Mandarin translation tasks show that our proposed approach improves the system performance significantly, up to 3.4% relative WER reduction in Cantonese transcription and 13.3% relative bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score improvement in Mandarin transcription compared with the system without reordering.</abstractText><title>Resolving Complex Cases of Definite The Winograd Schema Challenge</title><author>Rahman</author><affiliation>Human Language Technology Research University of Texas at</affiliation><abstractText>We examine the task of resolving complex cases of definite pronouns, specifically those for which traditional linguistic constraints on coreference (e.g., Binding Constraints, gender and number agreement) as well as commonly-used resolution heuristics (e.g., string-matching facilities, syntactic salience) are not useful. Being able to solve this task has broader implications in artificial intelligence: a restricted version of it, sometimes referred to as the Winograd Schema Challenge, has been suggested as a conceptually and practically appealing alternative to the Turing Test. We employ a knowledge-rich approach to this task, which yields a pronoun resolver that outperforms state-of-the-art resolvers by nearly 18 points in accuracy on our dataset.</abstractText><title>A Sequence Labelling Approach to Quote Attribution</title><author>R James</author><affiliation>School of IT of Informatics for Language Technology University of Sydney University of Edinburgh Macquarie University</affiliation><abstractText>Quote extraction and attribution is the task of automatically extracting quotes from text and attributing each quote to its correct speaker. The present state-of-the-art system uses gold standard information from previous decisions in its features, which, when removed, results in a large drop in performance. We treat the problem as a sequence labelling task, which allows us to incorporate sequence features without using gold standard information. We present results on two new corpora and an augmented version of a third, achieving a new state-of-the-art for systems using only realistic features.</abstractText><title>SSHLDA: A Semi-Supervised Hierarchical Topic Model</title><author>Tat-Seng Si Hongfei</author><affiliation>of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University, of Computing, National University of Singapore,</affiliation><abstractText>Supervised hierarchical topic modeling and unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling are usually used to obtain hierarchical topics, such as hLLDA and hLDA. Supervised hierarchical topic modeling makes heavy use of the information from observed hierarchical labels, but cannot explore new topics; while unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling is able to detect automatically new topics in the data space, but does not make use of any information from hierarchical labels. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised hierarchical topic model which aims to explore new topics automatically in the data space while incorporating the information from observed hierarchical lainto the modeling process, called Semi- Supervised Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Al- We also prove that hLDA and hLLDA are special cases of SSHLDA. We conduct experiments on Yahoo! Answers and ODP datasets, and assess the performance in terms of perplexity and clustering. The experimental results show that predictive ability of SSHLDA is better than that of baselines, and SSHLDA can also achieve significant improvement over baselines for clustering on the FScore measure.</abstractText><title>Improving NLP through Marginalization of Hidden Syntactic Structure</title><author>A</author><affiliation>Department of Computer University of Massachusetts</affiliation><abstractText>Many NLP tasks make predictions that are inherently coupled to syntactic relations, but for many languages the resources required to provide such syntactic annotations are unavailable. For others it is unclear exactly how much of the syntactic annotations can be effectively leveraged with current models, and what structures in the syntactic trees are most relevant to the current task. We propose a novel method which avoids the need for any syntactically annotated data when predicting a related NLP task. Our method couples latent syntactic representations, constrained to form valid dependency graphs or constituency parses, with the prediction task via specialized factors in a Markov random field. At both training and test time we marginalize over this hidden structure, learning the optimal latent representations for the problem. Results show that this approach provides significant gains over a syntactically uninformed baseline, outperforming models that observe syntax on an English relation extraction task, and performing comparably to them in semantic role labeling.</abstractText><title>Type-Supervised Hidden Markov Models for Part-of-Speech with Incomplete Tag Dictionaries</title><author>Jason</author><affiliation>Department of The University of Texas at</affiliation><abstractText>Past work on learning part-of-speech taggers from tag dictionaries and raw data has reported good results, but the assumptions made about those dictionaries are often unrealistic: due to historical precedents, they assume access to information about labels in the raw and test sets. Here, we demonstrate ways to learn hidden Markov model taggers from intag dictionaries. Taking the (Ravi et al., 2010) as a starting point, we improve it with several intuitive heuristics. We also define a simple HMM emission initialization that takes advantage of the tag dictionary and raw data to capture both the openness of a given tag and its estimated prevalence in the raw data. Altogether, our augmentations produce improvements to perover the original algorithm for both English and Italian data.</abstractText><title>Explore Person Specific Evidence in Web Person Name Disambiguation</title><author>Dongyan</author><affiliation>Institute of Computer Science and</affiliation><abstractText>In this paper, we investigate different usages of feature representations in the web person name disambiguation task which has been suffering from the mismatch of vocabulary and lack of clues in web environments. In literature, the latter receives less attention and remains more challenging. We explore the feature space in this task and argue that collecting person specific evidences from a corpus level can provide a more reasonable and robust estimation for evaluating a feature’s importance in a given web page. This can alleviate the of clues discriminative features can be reasonably weighted by taking their corpus level importance into account, not just relying on the current local context. We therefore propose a topic-based model to exploit the person specific global importance and embed it into the person name similarity. The experimental results show that the corpus level topic information provides more stable evidences for discriminative features and our method outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on three WePS datasets.</abstractText><title>Inducing a Discriminative Parser to Optimize Translation Reordering</title><author>Taro Shinsuke</author><affiliation>School of Informatics, Kyoto Yoshida Honmachi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan Institute of Information and Communication</affiliation><abstractText>This paper proposes a method for learning a discriminative parser for machine translation reordering using only aligned parallel text. This is done by treating the parser’s derivation tree as a latent variable in a model that is trained to maximize reordering accuracy. We demonstrate that efficient large-margin training is possible by showing that two measures of reordering accuracy can be factored over the parse tree. Using this model in the pre-ordering framework results in significant gains in translation accuracy over standard phrasebased SMT and previously proposed unsupervised syntax induction methods.</abstractText><title>Re-training Monolingual Parser Bilingually for Syntactic SMT</title><author>Li Zhou</author><affiliation>of Computer Science and Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin,</affiliation><abstractText>The training of most syntactic SMT approaches involves two essential components, word alignment and monolingual parser. In the current state of the art these two components are mutually independent, thus causing problems like lack of rule generalization, and violation of syntactic correspondence in translation rules. In this paper, we propose two ways of re-training monolingual parser with the target of maximizing the consistency between parse trees and alignment matrices. One is targeted self-training with a simple evaluation function; the other is based on training data selection from forced alignment of bilingual data. We also propose an auxiliary method for boosting alignment quality, by symmetrizing alignment matrices with respect to parse trees. The best combination of these novel methods achieves 3 Bleu point gain in an IWSLT task and more than 1 Bleu point gain in NIST tasks.</abstractText><title>Transforming Trees to Improve Syntactic Convergence</title><author>Burkett</author><affiliation>Computer Science University of California,</affiliation><abstractText>We describe a transformation-based learning method for learning a sequence of monolingual tree transformations that improve the agreement between constituent trees and word alignments in bilingual corpora. Using the manually annotated English Chinese Translation Treebank, we show how our method automatically discovers transformations that accommodate differences in English and Chinese syntax. Furthermore, when transformations are learned on automatically generated trees and alignments from the same domain as the training data for a syntactic MT system, the transformed trees achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over baseline trees.</abstractText><title>Learning Constraints for Consistent Timeline Extraction</title><author>D Christopher</author><affiliation>Natural Language Processing Computer Science Stanford University, Stanford, CA,</affiliation><abstractText>We present a distantly supervised system for the temporal bounds (relations which only hold during certain times, as Unlike previous pipelined approaches, our model does not assume independence between each fluent or even between named entities with known connections (parent, spouse, employer, etc.). Instead, we model what makes timelines of fluents consistent by learning cross-fluent constraints, potentially spanning entities as well. For example, our model learns that someone is unlikely to start a job at age two or to marry someone who hasn’t been born yet. Our system achieves a 36% error reduction over a pipelined baseline.</abstractText><title>Identifying Constant and Unique Relations by using Time-Series Text</title><author>Yohei Kaji Yoshinaga</author><affiliation>Institute of Industrial University of</affiliation><abstractText>Because the real world evolves over time, numerous relations between entities written in presently available texts are already obsolete or will potentially evolve in the future. This study aims at resolving the intricacy in consistently compiling relations extracted from text, and presents a method for identifying constancy and uniqueness of the relations in the context of supervised learning. We exploit massive time-series web texts to induce features on the basis of time-series frequency and linguistic cues. Experimental results confirmed that the time-series frequency distributions contributed much to the recall of constancy identification and the precision of the uniqueness identification.</abstractText><title>No Noun Phrase Left Behind: Detecting and Typing Unlinkable Entities</title><author>Oren Mausam</author><affiliation> University of</affiliation><abstractText>Entity linking systems link noun-phrase mentions in text to their corresponding Wikipedia articles. However, NLP applications would gain from the ability to detect and type all entities mentioned in text, including the long tail of entities not prominent enough to have their own Wikipedia articles. In this paper we show that once the Wikipedia entities mentioned in a corpus of textual assertions are linked, this can further enable the detection and fine-grained typing of the unlinkable entities. Our proposed method for detecting unlinkable entities achieves 24% greater accuracy than a Named Entity Recognition baseline, and our method for fine-grained typing is able to propagate over 1,000 types from linked Wikipedia entities to unlinkable entities. Detection and typing of unlinkable entities can increase yield for NLP applications such as typed question answering.</abstractText><title>A Novel Discriminative Framework for Sentence-Level Discourse Analysis</title><author>T Raymond</author><affiliation>Department of Computer University of British</affiliation><abstractText>We propose a complete probabilistic discriminative framework for performing sentencelevel discourse analysis.

Paradigmatic representations of word context are based on potential substitutes of a word in contrast to syntagmatic representations based on properties of neighboring words. We compare a bigram based baseline model with several paradigmatic models and demonstrate significant gains in accuracy. Our best model based on Euclidean co-occurrence embedding combines the paradigmatic context representation with morphological and orthographic features and achieves 80% many-to-one accuracy on a 45-tag 1M word corpus.</abstractText><title>Exploring Topic Coherence over many models and many topics</title><author>Philip David David</author><affiliation>of California Los Angeles; Los Angeles, California, Livermore National Lab; Livermore, California,</affiliation><abstractText>We apply two new automated semantic evaluations to three distinct latent topic models. Both metrics have been shown to align with human evaluations and provide a balance between internal measures of information gain and comparisons to human ratings of coherent topics. We improve upon the measures by introducing new aggregate measures that allows for comparing complete topic models. We further compare the automated measures to other metrics for topic models, comparison to manually crafted semantic tests and document classification. Our experiments reveal that LDA and LSA each have different strengths; LDA best learns descriptive topics while LSA is best at creating a compact semantic representation of documents and words in a corpus.</abstractText><title>Entropy-based Pruning for Phrase-based Machine Translation</title><author>Alan</author><affiliation>Spoken Systems Lab, INESC-ID, Lisboa, Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA,</affiliation><abstractText>Phrase-based machine translation models have shown to yield better translations than Word-based models, since phrase pairs encode the contextual information that is needed for a more accurate translation. However, many phrase pairs do not encode any relevant context, which means that the translation event encoded in that phrase pair is led by smaller translation events that are independent from each other, and can be found on smaller phrase pairs, with little or no loss in translation accuracy. In this work, we propose a relative entropy model for translation models, that measures how likely a phrase pair encodes a translation event that is derivable using smaller translation events with similar probabilities. This model is then applied to phrase table pruning. Tests show that considerable amounts of phrase pairs can be excluded, without much impact on the translation quality. In fact, we show that better translations can be obtained using our pruned models, due to the compression of the search space during decoding.</abstractText><title>A Systematic Comparison of Phrase Table Pruning Techniques</title><author>Peng Xu</author><affiliation>Google Inc.</affiliation><abstractText>When trained on very large parallel corpora, the phrase table component of a machine translation system grows to consume vast computational resources.

First, when one system appears to outperform another, how does significance level relate in practice to the magnitude of the gain, to the size of the test set, to the similarity of the systems, and so on? Is it true that for each task there is a gain which roughly implies significance? We explore these issues across a range of NLP tasks using both large collections of past systems’ outputs and variants of single systems. Next, once significance levels are computed, how well does the standard i.i.d. notion of significance hold up in practical settings where future distributions are neither independent nor identically distributed, such as across domains? We explore this question using a range of test set variations for constituency parsing.</abstractText><title>Employing Compositional Semantics and Discourse Consistency Chinese Event Extraction</title><author>Libin Hou</author><affiliation> Technology</affiliation><abstractText>Current Chinese event extraction systems suffer much from two problems in trigger identification: unknown triggers and word segmentation errors to known triggers.

Unsupervised algorithms are developed to extract relations from a corpus without knowing the relations in advance, but most of them rely on tagging arguments of predefined types. Recently, a new algorithm was proposed to jointly extract relations and their argument semantic classes, taking a set of relation instances extracted by an open IE algorithm as input. However, it cannot handle polysemy of relation phrases and fails to group many similar (“synonymous”) relation instances because of the sparseness of features. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised algorithm that provides a more general treatment of the polysemy and synonymy problems. The algorithm incorporates various knowledge sources which we will show to be very effective for unsupervised extraction. Moreover, it explicitly disambiguates polysemous relation phrases and groups synonymous ones. While maintaining approximately the same precision, the algorithm achieves significant improvement on recall compared to the previous method. It is also very efficient. Experiments on a realworld dataset show that it can handle 14.7 million relation instances and extract a very large set of relations from the web.</abstractText><title>Forest Reranking through Subtree Ranking</title><author>Helmut</author><affiliation>Institute for Natural Language University of Stuttgart</affiliation><abstractText>propose the ranking to forest reranking is a generalization of current perceptron-based reranking methods. For the training of the reranker, we extract competing local subtrees, hence the training instances (candidate subtree sets) are very similar to those used during beamsearch parsing. This leads to better parameter optimization. Another chief advantage of the framework is that arbitrary learning to rank methods can be applied. We evaluated our reranking approach on German and English phrase structure parsing tasks and compared it to various state-of-the-art reranking approaches such as the perceptron-based forest reranker. The subtree ranking approach with a Maximum Entropy model significantly outperformed the other approaches.</abstractText><title>Parser Showdown at the Wall Street Corral: An Empirical Investigation of Error Types in Parser Output</title><author>K R</author><affiliation>Science Division School of IT University of California, Berkeley University of Sydney</affiliation><abstractText>Constituency parser performance is primarily interpreted through a single metric, F-score 23, that conveys no linguistic information regarding the remaining errors. We classify errors within a set of linguistically meaningful types using tree transformations that repair groups of errors together. We use this analysis to answer a range of questions about parser behaviour, including what linguistic constructions are difficult for stateof-the-art parsers, what types of errors are being resolved by rerankers, and what types are introduced when parsing out-of-domain text.</abstractText><title>Extending Machine Translation Evaluation Metrics with Lexical To Document Level</title><author>T M Wong</author><affiliation>Department of Chinese, Translation and City University of Hong</affiliation><abstractText>This paper proposes the utilization of lexical cohesion to facilitate evaluation of machine translation at the document level. As a linguistic means to achieve text coherence, lexical cohesion ties sentences together into a meaningfully interwoven structure through words with the same or related meaning. A comparison between machine and human translation is conducted to illustrate one of their critical distinctions that human translators tend to use more cohesion devices than machine. Various ways to apply this feature to evaluate machinetranslated documents are presented, including one without reliance on reference translation. Experimental results show that incorporating this feature into sentence-level evaluation metrics can enhance their correlation with human judgements.</abstractText><title>Fast Large-Scale Approximate Graph Construction for NLP</title><author>Raul Guerra</author><affiliation>Dept. of Computer University of Maryland</affiliation><abstractText>Many natural language processing problems involve constructing large nearest-neighbor We propose a system called to construct such graphs approximately from large data sets.

If a computer can reliably extract information from them, it will greatly benefit a variety of applications. Short listings are, however, challenging to process due to their informal styles. In this paper, we present an unsupervised information extraction system for short listings. Given a corpus of listings, the system builds a semantic model that represents typical objects and their attributes in the domain of the corpus, and then uses the model to extract information. Two key features in the system are a semantic parser that extracts objects and their attributes and a listing-focused clustering module that helps group together extracted tokens of same type. Our evaluation shows that the semantic model learned by these two modules is effective across multiple domains.</abstractText><title>Sketch Algorithms for Estimating Point Queries in NLP</title><author>Hal Daum´e Graham Cormode</author><affiliation>T Labs–Research</affiliation><abstractText>Many NLP tasks rely on accurate statistics from large corpora.

In this paper we propose an alternative MCMC sampling scheme in which transition probabilities are approximated by sampling from the set of relevant factors.

Typically, in structured prediction, an inference procedure is applied to each example independently of the others. In this paper, we seek to optimize the time complexity of inference over entire datasets, rather than individual examples. By considering the general inference representation provided by integer linear programs, we propose three exact inference theorems which allow us to re-use earlier solutions for certain instances, thereby completely avoiding possibly expensive calls to the inference procedure. We also identify several approximation schemes which can provide further speedup. We instantiate these ideas to the structured prediction task of semantic role labeling and show that we can achieve a speedup of over 2.5 using our approach while retaining the guarantees of exactness and a further speedup of over 3 using approximations that do not degrade performance.</abstractText><title>PATTY: A Taxonomy of Relational Patterns with Semantic Types</title><author>Germany</author><abstractText>This paper presents PATTY: a large resource for textual patterns that denote binary relations between entities.

We present an approach where multiple annotations coexist, but in a factored manner that avoids this combinatorial explosion. Our method works with linguisticallymotivated annotations, induced latent structure, lexicalization, or any mix of the three. We use a structured expectation propagation algorithm that makes use of the factored structure in two ways. First, by partitioning the factors, it speeds up parsing exponentially over the unfactored approach. Second, it minimizes the redundancy of the factors during training, improving accuracy over an independent approach. Using purely latent variable annotations, we can efficiently train and parse with up to 8 latent bits per symbol, achieving F1 scores up to 88.4 on the Penn Treebank while using two orders of magnitudes fewer parameters compared to the naive approach.

We contribute two changes that trade between accuracy of these estimates and memory, holding sentence-level scores constant. Common practice uses lowerentries in an model to score the first few words of a fragment; this violates assumptions made by common smoothing strategies, including Kneser-Ney. Instead, we use a unigram model to score the first word, a bigram for the second, etc. This improves search at the expense of memory. Conversely, we show how to save memory by collapsing probability and backoff into a single value without changing sentence-level scores, at the expense of less accurate estimates for sentence fragments. These changes can be stacked, achieving better estimates with unchanged memory usage. In order to interpret changes in search accuracy, we adjust the pop limit so that accuracy is unchanged and report the change in CPU time. In a German- English Moses system with target-side syntax, improved estimates yielded a 63% reduction in CPU time; for a Hiero-style version, the reduction is 21%. The compressed language model uses 26% less RAM while equivalent search quality takes 27% more CPU.

The new segmentation is generated by extending the sequence of anchored phrase pairs with random elements starting at the next free position, proceeding from left to right until whole range covered. 4 Experimental Results In this section, we present the results of a series of experiments with our document decoder. The goal of our experiments is to demonstrate the behaviour of the decoder and characterise its response to changes in the fundamental search parameters. The SMT models for our experiments were created with a subset of the training data for the English-French shared task at the WMT 2011 workshop (Callison-Burch et al., 2011). The phrase table was trained on Europarl, news-commentary and UN data. To reduce the training data to a manageable size, singleton phrase pairs were removed before the phrase scoring step. Significance-based filtering (Johnson et al., 2007) was applied to the resulting phrase table. The language model was a 5gram model with Kneser-Ney smoothing trained on the monolingual News corpus with IRSTLM (Federico et al., 2008). Feature weights were trained with Minimum Error-Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003) on the news-test2008 development set using the DP beam search decoder and the MERT implementation of the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007). Experimental results are reported for the newstest2009 test set, a corpus of 111 newswire documents totalling 2,525 sentences or 65,595 English input tokens. 4.1 Stability An important difference between our decoder and the classical DP decoder as well as previous work in SMT decoding with local search is that our decoder is inherently non-deterministic. This implies that repeated runs of the decoder with the same search parameters, input and models will not, in general, find the same local maximum of the score space. The first empirical question we ask is therefore how different the results are under repeated runs. The results in this and the next section were obtained with random state initialisation, i. e. without running the DP beam search decoder. Figure 1 shows the results of 7 decoder runs with the models described above, translating the newstest set, with a step limit of a rejeclimit of 100,000. The of both plots shows the number of decoding steps on a logarithmic scale, so the number of steps is doubled between two adjacent points on the same curve. In the left plot, the indicates the model score optimised by the decoder summed over all 2525 sentences of the document. In the right plot, the case-sensitive BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) of the current decoder 1184 Figure 1: Score stability in repeated decoder runs state against a reference translation is displayed. We note, as expected, that the decoder achieves a considerable improvement of the initial state with diminishing returns as decoding continues. Beand steps, the score increases at a roughly logarithmic pace, then the curve flattens out, which is partly due to the fact that decoding for some documents effectively stopped when the maximum number of rejections was reached. The BLEU score curve shows a similar increase, from an initial score below 5 % to a maximum of around 21.5 %. This is below the score of 22.45 % achieved by the beam search decoder with the same models, which is not surprising considering that our decoder approximates a more difficult search problem, from which a number of strong independence assumptions have been lifted, without, at the moment, having any stronger models at its disposal to exploit this additional freedom for better translation. In terms of stability, there are no dramatic differences between the decoder runs. Indeed, the small differences that exist are hardly discernible in the plots. The model scores at the end of the decodrun range between and a relative difference of only about 0.03 %. Final BLEU scores range from 21.41 % to 21.63 %, an interval that is not negligible, but comparable to the variance observed when, e. g., feature weights from repeated MERT runs are used with one and the same SMT system. Note that these results were obtained with random state initialisation. With DP initialisation, score differences between repeated runs rarely exceed 0.02 absolute BLEU percentage points. Overall, we conclude that the decoding results of our algorithm are reasonably stable despite the nondeterminism inherent in the procedure. In our subsequent experiments, the evaluation scores reported are calculated as the mean of three runs for each experiment. 4.2 Search Algorithm Parameters The hill climbing algorithm we use has two parameters which govern the trade-off between decoding time and the accuracy with which a local maximum identified: The limit the search process after a certain number of steps regardless of the progress made or lack thereof. The the search after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts to make a step, when continued search does not seem to be promising. In most of our we used a step limit of pz� a rejection limit of In practice, decoding terminates by reaching the rejection limit for the vast majority of documents. We therefore examined the effect of different rejection limits on the learning curves. The results are shown in figure 2. The results show that continued search does pay off to a certain extent. Indeed, the curve for relimit seems to indicate that the model score increases roughly logarithmically, albeit to a higher base, even after the curve has started to flatout at steps. At a certain point, however, the probability of finding a good successor state drops rather sharply by about two orders of magnitude, as 1185 Figure 2: Search performance at different rejection limits by the fact that a rejection limit of not give a large improvement over one of one of does. The continued model score improvement also results in an increase in BLEU scores, and with a BLEU score of 22.1 % the system rejection limit is fairly close to the score of 22.45 % obtained by DP beam search. Obviously, more exact search comes at a cost, and in this case, it comes at a considerable cost, which is an explosion of the time required to decode the test from 4 minutes at rejection limit to 224 minat rejection limit and 38 hours 45 minutes limit The DP decoder takes 31 minutes for the same task. We conclude that the rejection limit selected for our experiments, while technically suboptimal, realises a good trade-off between decoding time and accuracy. 4.3 A Semantic Document Language Model In this section, we present the results of the application of our decoder to an actual SMT model with cross-sentence features. Our model addresses the of In particular, it rewards the use of semantically related words in the translation output by the decoder, where semantic distance is measured with a word space model based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). LSA has been applied to semantic language modelling in previous research with some success (Coccaro and Jurafsky, 1998; Bellegarda, 2000; Wandmacher and Antoine, 2007). In SMT, it has mostly been used for domain adaptation (Kim and Khudanpur, 2004; Tam et al., 2007), or to measure sentence similarities (Banchs and Costa-juss`a, 2011). The model we use is inspired by Bellegarda (2000). It is a Markov model, similar to a standard n-gram model, and assigns to each content a score given a history of content where below. Scoring relies on a 30dimensional LSA word vector space trained with the S-Space software (Jurgens and Stevens, 2010). The score is defined based on the cosine similarity between the word vector of the predicted word and the mean word vector of the words in the history, which is converted to a probability by histogram lookup as suggested by Bellegarda (2000). The model is structurally different from a regular n-gram model in that word vector n-grams are defined over content words occurring in the word vector model only and can cross sentence boundaries. Stop words, identified by an extensive stop word list and amounting to around 60 % of the tokens, are scored by a different mechanism based on their relative frequency (undiscounted unigram probability) in the training corpus. In sum, the score produced by the semantic document LM has the following form: a stop word, else known, else (15) unknown, the proportion of content words in the corpus and a small fixed probability. It is integrated into the decoder as an extra feature function. Since we lack an automatic method for = { 1186 training the feature weights of document-wide features, its weight was selected by grid search over a number of values, comparing translation performance for the newstest2009 test set. In these experiments, we used DP beam search to initialise the state of our local search decoder. Three results are presented (table 1): The first table row shows the baseline performance using DP beam search with standard sentence-local features only. The scores in the second row were obtained by running the hill climbing decoder with DP initialisation, but without adding any models. A marginal increase in scores for all three test sets demonstrates that the hill climbing decoder manages to fix some of the search errors made by the DP search. The last row contains the scores obtained by adding in the semantic language model. Scores are presented for three publicly available test sets from recent WMT Machine Translation shared tasks, of which one (newstest2009) was used to monitor progress during development and select the final model. Adding the semantic language model results in a small increase in NIST scores (Doddington, 2002) for all three test sets as well as a small BLEU score gain (Papineni et al., 2002) for two out of three corpora. We note that the NIST score turned out to react more sensitively to improvements due to the semantic LM in all our experiments, which is reasonable because the model specifically targets content words, which benefit from the information weighting done by the NIST score. While the results we present do not constitute compelling evidence in favour of our semantic LM in its current form, they do suggest that this model could be improved to realise higher gains from cross-sentence semantic information. They support our claim that crosssentence models should be examined more closely and that existing methods should be adapted to deal with them, a problem addressed by our main contribution, the local search document decoder. 5 Related Work Even though DP beam search (Koehn et al., 2003) has been the dominant approach to SMT decoding in recent years, methods based on local search have been explored at various times. For word-based greedy hill-climbing techniques were advocated as a faster replacement for beam search (Germann et al., 2001; Germann, 2003; Germann et al., 2004), and a problem formulation specifically targeting word reordering with an efficient word reordering algorithm has been proposed (Eisner and Tromble, 2006). A local search decoder has been advanced as a faster alternative to beam search also for phrasebased SMT (Langlais et al., 2007; Langlais et al., 2008). That work anticipates many of the features found in our decoder, including the use of local search to refine an initial hypothesis produced by DP beam search. The possibility of using models that do not fit well into the beam search paradigm is mentioned and illustrated with the example of a reversed n-gram language model, which the authors claim would be difficult to implement in a beam search decoder. Similarly to the work by Germann et al. (2001), their decoder is deterministic and explores the entire neighbourhood of a state in order to identify the most promising step.

We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them.</abstractText><title>Polarity Inducing Latent Semantic Analysis</title><author>Wen-tau Yih Geoffrey Zweig John C Platt</author><affiliation>Microsoft</affiliation><abstractText>Existing vector space models typically map synonyms and antonyms to similar word vectors, and thus fail to represent antonymy. We introduce a new vector space representation where antonyms lie on opposite sides of a sphere: in the word vector space, synonyms have cosine similarities close to one, while antonyms are close to minus one. We derive this representation with the aid of a thesaurus and latent semantic analysis (LSA). Each entry in the thesaurus – a word sense along with its synonyms and antonyms – is treated as a “document,” and the resulting document collection is subjected to LSA. The key contribution of this work is to show how to assign signs to the entries in the co-occurrence matrix on which LSA operates, so as to induce a subspace with the desired property. We evaluate this procedure with the Graduate Record Examination questions of (Mohammed et al., 2008) and find that the method improves on the results of that study. Further improvements result from refining the subspace representation with discriminative training, and augmenting the training data with general newspaper text.

We incorporate an inductive bias into grammar learning in favor of grammars that lead to unambiguous parses on natural language sentences. The resulting family of algorithms includes the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) and its variant, Viterbi EM, as well as a so-called softmax-EM algorithm. The softmax-EM algorithm can be implemented with a simple and computationally efficient extension to standard EM.

Our experiments, on new and gold-standard datasets, show that our wide-coverage framework enables highperformance results on dozens of domains at a coarse and fine-grained level.</abstractText><title>Grounded Models of Semantic Representation</title><author>Silberer</author><affiliation>Institute for Language, Cognition and School of Informatics, University of</affiliation><abstractText>A popular tradition of studying semantic representation has been driven by the assumption that word meaning can be learned from the linguistic environment, despite ample evsuggesting that language is in perception and action. In this paper we present a comparative study of models that represent word meaning based on linguistic and perceptual data. Linguistic information is approximated by naturally occurring corpora and sensorimotor experience by feature norms (i.e., attributes native speakers consider important in describing the meaning of a word). The models differ in terms of the mechanisms by which they integrate the two modalities. Experimental results show that a closer correspondence to human data can be obtained by uncovering latent information shared among the textual and perceptual modalities rather than arriving at semantic knowledge by concatenating the two.</abstractText><title>Improved Parsing and POS Tagging Using Consistency Constraints</title><author>M Roi Michael</author><abstractText>State-of-the-art statistical parsers and POS taggers perform very well when trained with large amounts of in-domain data. When training data is out-of-domain or limited, accuracy degrades. In this paper, we aim to compensate for the lack of available training data by exploiting similarities between test set sentences. We show how to augment sentencelevel models for parsing and POS tagging with inter-sentence consistency constraints. To deal with the resulting global objective, we present an efficient and exact dual decomposition decoding algorithm. In experiments, we add consistency constraints to the MST parser and the Stanford part-of-speech tagger and demonstrate significant error reduction in the domain adaptation and the lightly supervised settings across five languages.</abstractText><title>Unified Dependency Parsing of Chinese and Syntactic Structures</title><author>Zhongguo Li Guodong Zhou</author><affiliation>Natural Language Processing School of Computer Science and</affiliation><abstractText>Most previous approaches to syntactic parsing of Chinese rely on a preprocessing step of word segmentation, thereby assuming there was a clearly defined boundary between morphology and syntax in Chinese. We show how this assumption can fail badly, leading to many out-of-vocabulary words and incompatible annotations. Hence in practice the strict separation of morphology and syntax in the Chinese language proves to be untenable. We present a unified dependency parsing approach for Chinese which takes unsegmented sentences as input and outputs both morphological and syntactic structures with a single model and algorithm. By removing the intermediate word segmentation, the unified parser no longer needs separate notions for words and phrases. Evaluation proves the effectiveness of the unified model and algorithm in parsing structures of words, phrases and sensimultaneously.</abstractText><title>A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing</title><author>Bernd</author><affiliation>Department of Linguistics and</affiliation><abstractText>Most current dependency parsers presuppose that input words have been morphologically disambiguated using a part-of-speech tagger before parsing begins. We present a transitionbased system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with nonprojective trees. Experimental evaluation on Chinese, Czech, English and German shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy when compared to a pipeline system, which lead to improved state-of-theart results for all languages.</abstractText><title>Identifying Event-related Bursts via Social Media Activities</title><author>Peking</author><affiliation>of Information Systems, Singapore Management</affiliation><abstractText>Activities on social media increase at a dramatic rate. When an external event happens, there is a surge in the degree of activities related to the event. These activities may be temporally correlated with one another, but they may also capture different aspects of an event and therefore exhibit different bursty patterns. In this paper, we propose to identify event-related bursts via social media activities. We study how to correlate multiple types of activities to derive a global bursty pattern. To model smoothness of one state sequence, we propose a novel function which can capture the state context. The experiments on a large Twitter dataset shows our methods are very effective.</abstractText><title>User Demographics and Language in an Implicit Social Network</title><author>Katja</author><affiliation>Google Brandschenkestr.</affiliation><abstractText>We consider the task of predicting the gender the users and contrast two information sources: the comments they leave and the social environment induced from the affiliation graph of users and videos. We propagate gender information through the videos and show that a user’s gender can be predicted from her social environment with the accuracy above 90%. We also show that the gender can be predicted from language alone (89%). A surprising result of our study is that the latter predictions correlate more strongly with the gender predominant in the user’s environment than with the sex of the person as reported in the profile. We also investigate how the two views (linguistic and social) can be combined and analyse how prediction accuracy changes over different age groups.</abstractText><title>Revisiting the Predictability of Response Completion in Social Media</title><author>Bo Pang Sujith Ravi</author><affiliation>Yahoo! Research</affiliation><abstractText>The question “how predictable is English?” has long fascinated researchers. While prior work has focused on formal English typically used in news articles, we turn to texts generated by users in online settings that are more informal in nature. We are motivated by a novel application scenario: given the difficulty of typing on mobile devices, can we help reduce typing effort with message completion, especially in conversational settings? We propose a method for automatic response completion. Our approach models both the language used in responses and the specific context provided by the original message. Our experimental results on a large-scale dataset show that both components help reduce typing effort. We also perform an information-theoretic study in this setting and examine the entropy of user-generated content, especially in conversational scenarios, to better understand predictability of user generated English.</abstractText><title>A Discriminative Model for Query Spelling Correction with Structural SVM</title><author>Dan</author><affiliation>University of Illinois at</affiliation><abstractText>Discriminative training in query spelling correction is difficult due to the complex internal structures of the data. Recent work on query spelling correction suggests a two stage approach a noisy channel model that is used to retrieve a number of candidate corrections, followed by discriminatively trained ranker applied to these candidates. The ranker, however, suffers from the fact the low recall of the first, suboptimal, search stage. This paper proposes to directly optimize the search stage with a discriminative model based on latent structural SVM. In this model, we treat query spelling correction as a multiclass classification problem with structured input and output. The latent structural information is used to model the alignment of words in the spelling correction process. Experiment results show that as a standalone speller, our model outperforms all the baseline systems. It also attains a higher recall compared with the noisy channel model, and can therefore serve as a better filtering stage when combined with a ranker.</abstractText></main><citationlists><author>Anton Bakalov</author><author>Alexandra Balahur</author><author>Niranjan Balasubramanian</author><author>Timothy Baldwin</author><author>Carmen
